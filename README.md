# FAQ and need-to-knows:

## Minecraft not launching?
  If you are on newer versions (you can sign into your microsoft account), then check your minecraft logs, and maybe file a issue. If you are on an older version, then that is because I may have disconected the launch function for legal reasons. <details><summary>Legal Reasons</summary> Basically hidden in the files is a way to launch minecraft with the test options (without a minecraft/microsoft account, so for free), and if I released that to the public with access to the test options, then mojang would probably sue us. </details>
